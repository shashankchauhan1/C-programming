Q What is file?
>> It is a container in a storage device to store data.

there's a volatile and non-volatile memory.

Volatile: the data in the ram
non-Volatile: the data in secondary storage

volatile means the data will vanish off when the device is switched off but non-volatile doesn't vanish the data after switching off.
so, in volatile the program runs which is stores in a non-volatile memory.

OPERATION on files:
>> create
>> open
>> close
>> read
>> write

Types of files:
>> text(textual data) abcd.....	so on.  { example: .txt, .c }
>> binary(binary data) 0100101.... so on.		{ example: .exe, .mp3, .jpg }
 
>> RAM is volatile.
>> contents are lost when the program terminates.
>> files are used to presist(maintain, store)the data.
